            "{'ANU_filtered_reformed.txt': '9 November 2018: spearphishing email one. The actor’s campaign started with a spearphishing email sent to the mailbox of a senior member of staff. Based on available logs this email was only previewed but the malicious code contained in the email did not require the recipient to click on any link nor download and open an attachment. This “interaction-less” attack resulted in the senior staff member’s credentials being sent to several external web addresses. It is highly likely that the credentials taken from this account were used to gain access to other systems. The actor also gained access to the senior staff member’s calendar – information which was used to conduct additional spearphishing attacks later in the actor’s campaign. 12−14 November 2018: webserver infrastructure compromised. It is probable that the actor used credentials gained on 9 November to successfully access an Internet-facing webserver used by one of the University’s schools. The actor successfully created a webshell on this webserver which was then used, over two days, to conduct command and control (C2) operations through what is known as a TOR exit node.8,9 These activities were likely designed to set up infrastructure and tools to be used throughout the actor’s campaign. 9 November 2018: spearphishing email one.

The actor successfully created a webshell on this webserver which was then used, over two days, to conduct command and control (C2) operations through what is known as a TOR exit node.8,9 These activities were likely designed to set up infrastructure and tools to be used throughout the actor’s campaign. 27 November: access to ESD file shares achieved. At this stage the actor did not appear to have the relevant credentials needed for their campaign and over the course of 27 November, began a network-wide attempt to compromise a range of servers using exploits or stolen credentials. The actor eventually found credentials to access file shares in ESD and other parts of the network; and mapping directory structures. However the actor displays no interest in file shares other than those in ESD. The file share in ESD is a temporary storage location used by several business units, normally to facilitate the routine extraction and manipulation of data such as finance and HR records. The actor also starts to map out machines in ESD and locates servers housing the databases underpinning ANU HR, finance, student administration and e-forms systems. Upon finding these databases the actor tries repeatedly, and unsuccessfully, to access these systems. Late on 27 November the actor downloads source code for a bespoke toolset or malware; this code is then compiled and run. The nature of this code is unknown as the actor wiped it and the compiled executable after use. Executable files allow source code to run on a machine. Forensic evidence also shows the extensive use of password cracking tools at this stage. The combination of the bespoke code and password cracking is very likely to have been the mechanism for gaining access to the above administrative databases or their host systems. The actor then accessed the administrative databases directly using a commercial tool. This tool allowed the actor to connect to several databases at once to search and extract records; and convert them to PDF format. The PDFs were then sent to the compromised school machine one for extraction from the ANU network.13 29 November 2018: third spearphishing attempt. The actor continues to look for credentials and tries to maximise the effectiveness of their spearphishing efforts by connecting to the University’s spam filer and attempting to disable its ability to detect malicious emails. There is no forensic evidence to suggest that they were successful in this attempt. The actor then sent 75 emails, 50 to ANU addresses and the remainder to external email addresses. These were used to either exfiltrate data or to undertake more spearphishing. The actor was able to harvest at least one administrator credential during this spearphishing phase. 29 November−13 December 2018: clean-up operations and loss of attack station one. As noted earlier, the actor displayed a very high degree of operational security and routinely erased files and logs. One such clean up phase commenced on 29 November with the actor erasing files and tools with logs packaged for exfiltration through school machine one, which itself was also subject to clean up operations. It is believed that the actor was preparing attack station one for the next phase of their campaign. On 30 November the ANU implemented a routine firewall change. This cut the actor off from attack station one. The actor immediately then initiated activity to try and get back on to attack station one or to find another place in the network to resume operations. This activity continued until 13 December. 13−20 December 2018: new attack station and resumption of exfiltration. After nearly two weeks of effort the actor restores their access to the network through a machine running a legacy operating system in a second school – referred to in the remainder of the report as attack station two. This machine was subject to a large amount of C2 activity between 13 and 19 December. Forensic analysis suggests this activity is associated with the actor preparing attack station two presumably to either continue extracting data from ESD or to start a new phase of the campaign. On 19 December, the actor exfiltrated 13 additional files, compressed into archives, through TOR. At the time of this activity, the school hosting attack station two was not behind the University firewalls and was using publicly routable IP addresses. The actor also probed other parts of the network for other vulnerable systems and began updating malware on attack station two. These updates were likely preparing attack station two for continued access into ESD or the rest of the network. 21 December 2018: fourth spearphishing attempt and loss of attack station two. The actor starts to target users with administrative access and sends 40 phishing emails to ANU staff with privileged accounts. This email, entitled “New Planning for Information Technology Services” used calendar information gained from the first spearphishing campaign.14 This phishing attempt was successful in harvesting a handful of privileged accounts, but ANU IT staff detected the unusual behaviour and were able to remove the new attack station from the network. At the time, however, this activity was treated as an individual event, by ANU IT, rather than part of a broader campaign. Prior to the loss of attack station two the actor was able to scan an Internet facing web server. This formed the basis of a subsequent intrusion attempt in February 2019. 22 December 2018 – March 2019: C2 activity and second intrusion attempt. As noted above there was an intrusion attempt in February 2019 against an externally facing webserver. This attack was ultimately unsuccessful but given the similarities in tradecraft used between the November and February attacks, the latter was likely a further attempt by the same actor to regain access to ESD. This activity also aligns to C2 activity seen throughout January and in early March, which was the last known activity by the actor.'}\n",

            "ANU_filtered_reformed_summarized :     Here's how I would rewrite the report: Introduction: In December 2018, a cybersecurity incident occurred at Australian National University (ANU), involving unauthorized access to the university's computer systems. The incident started with a spearphishing campaign that successfully harvested several privileged accounts. The actor then used these accounts to gain access to the university's network and extract sensitive data. Analysis: The actor's initial entry point into the university's network was through a spearphishing campaign that targeted ANU staff with administrative access. The email used calendar information gained from the previous spearphishing attempt to create a sense of urgency and legitimacy. Of note, this phishing attempt was successful in harvesting a handful of privileged accounts. Following the successful phishing attempt, the actor began scanning the university's internet-facing web server, indicating potential interest in exploiting vulnerabilities. Subsequent intrusion attempts were made in February 2019 against an external web server, although these were ultimately unsuccessful. However, the similarity in tactics used between the November and February attacks suggests they may have been part of a larger campaign. C2 activity was observed throughout January and early March, indicating the actor was still actively engaged in the incident. Findings: Based on the available information, it appears the actor's primary objective was to extract sensitive data from the university's computer systems. The actor used various techniques to gain access to the network, including spearphishing and scanning internet-facing servers. Once inside the network, the actor updated their malware to prepare for continued access or to exploit other vulnerabilities. Recommendations: To prevent similar incidents in the future, it is essential to implement robust security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, regular security audits, and employee training on cybersecurity best practices. Additionally, monitoring internet-facing servers for suspicious activity can help detect potential threats before they escalate. Conclusion: The incident at ANU highlights the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures to protect against sophisticated threats. By understanding the tactics and techniques used by the actor, organizations can better prepare themselves for potential incidents and minimize the impact of any successful attacks.\n",

At this stage the actor did not appear to have the relevant credentials needed for their campaign and over the course of 27 November, began a network-wide attempt to compromise a range of servers using exploits or stolen credentials. The actor eventually found credentials to access file shares in ESD and other parts of the network; and mapping directory structures. However the actor displays no interest in file shares other than those in ESD. The file share in ESD is a temporary storage location used by several business units, normally to facilitate the routine extraction and manipulation of data such as finance and HR records. The actor also starts to map out machines in ESD and locates servers housing the databases underpinning ANU HR, finance, student administration and e-forms systems.

The actor also starts to map out machines in ESD and locates servers housing the databases underpinning ANU HR, finance, student administration and e-forms systems. Upon finding these databases the actor tries repeatedly, and unsuccessfully, to access these systems. Late on 27 November the actor downloads source code for a bespoke toolset or malware; this code is then compiled and run. The nature of this code is unknown as the actor wiped it and the compiled executable after use. Executable files allow source code to run on a machine. Forensic evidence also shows the extensive use of password cracking tools at this stage. The combination of the bespoke code and password cracking is very likely to have been the mechanism for gaining access to the above administrative databases or their host systems.

The actor then accessed the administrative databases directly using a commercial tool. This tool allowed the actor to connect to several databases at once to search and extract records; and convert them to PDF format. The PDFs were then sent to the compromised school machine one for extraction from the ANU network.13 29 November 2018: third spearphishing attempt. The actor continues to look for credentials and tries to maximise the effectiveness of their spearphishing efforts by connecting to the University’s spam filer and attempting to disable its ability to detect malicious emails. There is no forensic evidence to suggest that they were successful in this attempt. The actor then sent 75 emails, 50 to ANU addresses and the remainder to external email addresses. These were used to either exfiltrate data or to undertake more spearphishing. The actor was able to harvest at least one administrator credential during this spearphishing phase. 29 November−13 December', metadata={}), Document(page_content='were used to either exfiltrate data or to undertake more spearphishing.

As noted earlier, the actor displayed a very high degree of operational security and routinely erased files and logs. One such clean up phase commenced on 29 November with the actor erasing files and tools with logs packaged for exfiltration through school machine one, which itself was also subject to clean up operations. It is believed that the actor was preparing attack station one for the next phase of their campaign. On 30 November the ANU implemented a routine firewall change. This cut the actor off from attack station one. The actor immediately then initiated activity to try and get back on to attack station one or to find another place in the network to resume operations.

This activity continued until 13 December. 13−20 December 2018: new attack station and resumption of exfiltration. After nearly two weeks of effort the actor restores their access to the network through a machine running a legacy operating system in a second school – referred to in the remainder of the report as attack station two. This machine was subject to a large amount of C2 activity between 13 and 19 December. Forensic analysis suggests this activity is associated with the actor preparing attack station two presumably to either continue extracting data from ESD or to start a new phase of the campaign. On 19 December, the actor exfiltrated 13 additional files, compressed into archives, through TOR.

At the time of this activity, the school hosting attack station two was not behind the University firewalls and was using publicly routable IP addresses. The actor also probed other parts of the network for other vulnerable systems and began updating malware on attack station two. These updates were likely preparing attack station two for continued access into ESD or the rest of the network. 21 December 2018: fourth spearphishing attempt and loss of attack station two. The actor starts to target users with administrative access and sends 40 phishing emails to ANU staff with privileged accounts. This email, entitled “New Planning for Information Technology Services” used calendar information gained from the first spearphishing campaign.14 This phishing attempt was successful in harvesting a handful of privileged accounts, but ANU IT staff detected the unusual behaviour and were able to remove the new attack station from the', metadata={}), Document(page_content='This phishing attempt was successful in harvesting a handful of privileged accounts, but ANU IT staff detected the unusual behaviour and were able to remove the new attack station from the network. At the time, however, this activity was treated as an individual event, by ANU IT, rather than part of a broader campaign. Prior to the loss of attack station two the actor was able to scan an Internet facing web server. This formed the basis of a subsequent intrusion attempt in February 2019. 22 December 2018 – March 2019: C2 activity and second intrusion attempt. As noted above there was an intrusion attempt in February 2019 against an externally facing webserver.
